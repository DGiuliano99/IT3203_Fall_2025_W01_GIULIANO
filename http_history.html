<h3>History of HTTP</h3> <!-- page title -->
<p>
    HTTP is a client-server protocol in which a client, a web browser or other web processing code, sends a <strong>request</strong> to a <strong>server</strong>, or collection of servers.
    The request is then processed by the server(s) where resources are gathered, encoded, and transmitted back to the client.
    This process was first invented in the late 1980s by Tim Bernerners-Lee who was working for the Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire
    (CERN) at the time. Berners-Lee developed HTTP based on HyperText, a method of displaying documents in which links, called <strong>hyperlinks</strong>, can be
    accessed by the client. This allows the user to seemingly control the content. This also allows for the efficient transfer of data between
    the server and the client. This allows the client to receive only the data needed at the time preventing whole file downloads which could be
    very time-consuming in the early days of the internet. HTTP protocol has continued to develop over time with major releases HTTP/2 and HTTP/3,
    released in 2015 and 2022 respectively, continuously adding additional features that improve the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of data
    transmission. It is likely that HTTP will continue to be developed upon for many years to come, with additional versions being released
    regularly with continued improvements in security and efficiency. Early on, efforts were made to create processes by which clients could
    modify and push data to web-applications and servers. This led to the development of WebDAV which was quickly expanded to include mechanisms to
    manage calendars, contact data, and more. A major advantage to WebDAV was its cross compatibility meaning that because of shared protocols, any
    WebDAV enabled client could communicate with any WebDAV enabled server.
