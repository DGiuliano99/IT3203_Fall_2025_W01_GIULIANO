    <li class="concepts">HTTP is a client-server protocol in which a client, a web browser or other web processing code, sends a request to a server, or collection of servers.</li>

    <li class="concepts">In the late 1980&#39;s, Tim Berners-Lee developed HTTP based on HyperText, a method of displaying documents in which links, called “hyperlinks”, can be accessed by the client</li>

    <li class="concepts">HTTP protocol has continued to develop over time with major releases HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, released in 2015 and 2022 respectively, continuously adding additional features that improve the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of data transmission. </li>
