<p>
    In the beginning days of computer networking, beginning primarily with governments and academic organizations, independent networks were set up
    to link computers either on the same campus or between affiliated campuses of partner organizations. One major problem limiting widespread adoption
    was the lack of consistent protocols that would allow for the free exchange of information between systems.
</p>
<p>
    Computer scientists across the globe were working on
    solutions to integrate networks. While the United States, specifically the Department of Defense, was instrumental in developing the technologies behind the
    primitive internet, it was not until researchers in Europe, working on network cross compatibility, that the true capabilities of the internet would begin to be
    realized.
</p>
<p>
    While this technology began just prior to the 1990&#39s, we are still using a version of HTTP protocol to the day, nearly thirty-six years later. There
    is no data exchanged on the internet that does not use HTTP.
